## Assignment
The challenge was to write a JavaScript program that calculates a individuals BMI index using either metric or imperial system. For testing we used testing framework Jasmine.

I worked with TDD from start to finish, using Jasmine.
I changed the features on the site with jQuery and Bootstrap.
